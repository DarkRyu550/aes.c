A simple implementation of the AES algorythm, made as part of a
self-imposed challange I took after a friend of mine mentioned he'd
have to fully implement it by the end of 2018. In the end, this
project ended up taking me, roughly, two afternoons (an hour and a
half in the first session, and then a whole day in the other) to go
from completely clueless as to what AES even was, exactly, to having
a functioning implementation.
